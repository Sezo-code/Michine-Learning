# Project Overview

In this Project ,i cover the full process of building a beginner machine learning project. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. By the end,  understanding how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.

To make this interesting, we'll use a fun dataset. We'll use data from historical Olympic games. I try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.


# Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which i follow here.  This outline will help  tackle any machine learning problem.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split the data.
7. Train a model.

## Code

You can find the code for this project 

File overview:

* `machine_learning.ipynb` - the main project code
* `data_prep.ipynb` - the code to generate the team-level dataset from an athlete-level dataset
