# Project Overview

In this Projects ,i cover the full process of building machine learning projects. 
This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error.

# Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which i follow here.  
This outline will help  tackle any machine learning problem.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split the data.
7. Train a model.
